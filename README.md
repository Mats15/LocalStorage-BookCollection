# Book collection
The main goal of this project was to create a book collection that is stored in the browsers localStorage.

The website is coded using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

You can start the project by typing .\index.html into the terminal.

The project website has a book collection where you can click on a book and the books details will appear in the text boxes on the left.

You can then edit the books details and click the Save button to save them or delete the book with the Delete button.

To add a new book to your collection, fill in all the details and click the Save New button.

When you save a book with the Save New or Save buttons, the book is saved into localStorage. 

When the page refreshes, the books remain in localStorage if they are not deleted with the Delete button.
